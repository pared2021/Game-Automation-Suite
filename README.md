## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-automation-control.git
   ```

2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd webapp
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python main/full_feature_launcher.py
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd webapp
   npm run serve
   ```

3. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8080`

## Configuration

Edit the configuration files in the `config` directory to customize the automation behavior and game settings. The project now supports hot-reloading of configuration files.
